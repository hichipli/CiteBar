# Contributing to CiteBar

Welcome to the CiteBar contributor community! üéâ 

Population: You + the maintainer(s) + probably a few caffeinated academics who found bugs at 2 AM.

## Getting Started

### First Time Here?

Don't worry, we don't bite! Here's how to get your feet wet:

1. **Star the repo** ‚≠ê (It makes us feel good about ourselves)
2. **Read the [README](README.md)** (Yes, the whole thing. We worked hard on it.)
3. **Browse the [issues](https://github.com/hichipli/CiteBar/issues)** to see what needs doing
4. **Set up your development environment** (instructions below)

### What We're Looking For

**Bug Fixes** üêõ
- Google Scholar changed their HTML again? We need you.
- App crashed when you added your 47th profile? Tell us about it.
- Menu bar disappeared into the void? Let's bring it back.

**Feature Enhancements** ‚ú®
- Better error messages (current ones are... adequate)
- UI/UX improvements (make it prettier!)
- Performance optimizations (faster is better)
- More citation metrics (h-index, i10-index, etc.)

**Future Vision** üîÆ
- Desktop widgets for macOS
- Citation trend charts and visualizations
- Export functionality (CSV, JSON, "formatted for my CV")
- Dark mode support (for those late-night citation checks)
- Notification system ("Your paper got cited! üéâ")

**Documentation** üìö
- Better installation guides
- Video tutorials (if you're into that)
- More examples and screenshots
- Translation to other languages

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

You'll need:
- macOS 13.0+ (this is a Mac app, after all)
- Apple Silicon Mac (M1, M2, M3, M4 series - Intel support coming soon!)
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- A functioning internet connection (for Google Scholar scraping)
- Coffee or tea (highly recommended)

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/hichipli/CiteBar.git
cd CiteBar

# Install Xcode Command Line Tools (if you haven't already)
xcode-select --install

# Build and run
make build
make run

# Or if you prefer GUI development
make xcode
```

### Development Commands

```bash
make build      # Build release version
make debug      # Build debug version (with extra logging)
make test       # Run unit tests
make clean      # Clean build artifacts
make install    # Install to /Applications
make help       # Show all available commands
```

## How to Contribute

### 1. Pick Your Adventure

**Option A: Fix a Bug**
- Find a bug in the [Issues](https://github.com/hichipli/CiteBar/issues)
- Comment "I'll take this one!" (or something equally enthusiastic)
- Fix it, test it, submit a PR

**Option B: Add a Feature**
- Check existing issues for feature requests
- Or suggest your own brilliant idea
- Discuss the approach first (saves everyone time)
- Build it, test it, submit a PR

**Option C: Improve Documentation**
- Found a typo? Fix it!
- Instructions unclear? Clarify them!
- Missing examples? Add them!

### 2. Development Workflow

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/amazing-new-thing

# Make your changes
# Write tests (if applicable)
# Update documentation (if needed)

# Test your changes
make test
make build

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add amazing new thing that does X"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/amazing-new-thing

# Create a Pull Request
```

### 3. Before You Submit

**Code Checklist:**
- [ ] Code builds without warnings
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] No force unwrapping without safety comments
- [ ] UI changes tested on different screen sizes
- [ ] Memory leaks checked (if doing complex operations)

**Documentation Checklist:**
- [ ] README updated (if adding features)
- [ ] Code comments added for complex logic
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated (we'll help with this)

## Code Style Guidelines

### Swift Style

We follow [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/) with these preferences:

```swift
// Good: Clear, explicit types
let citationCount: Int = 42
let profileName: String = "Dr. Awesome"

// Bad: Unclear types
let count = 42
let name = "Dr. Awesome"

// Good: Descriptive function names
func fetchCitationCountForProfile(_ profile: ScholarProfile) -> Int

// Bad: Unclear function names
func fetch(_ profile: ScholarProfile) -> Int

// Good: Safe unwrapping with context
guard let url = URL(string: urlString) else {
    logger.error("Invalid URL string: \(urlString)")
    return
}

// Bad: Force unwrapping without context
let url = URL(string: urlString)!
```

### Architecture Patterns

**Thread Safety:**
- Use `@MainActor` for UI components
- Use `actor` for shared data storage
- Prefer `async/await` over completion handlers

**Error Handling:**
- Use `Result<Success, Error>` for fallible operations
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately

**Data Flow:**
- Settings ‚Üí SettingsManager (ObservableObject)
- Storage ‚Üí StorageManager (Actor)
- UI Updates ‚Üí MainActor only

### Comments & Documentation

```swift
/// Fetches citation count from Google Scholar profile
/// - Parameter profile: The scholar profile to fetch data for
/// - Returns: Citation count or nil if parsing fails
/// - Note: Includes 2-second delay to respect rate limits
func fetchCitationCount(for profile: ScholarProfile) async -> Int? {
    // Implementation...
}
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Or directly with Swift
swift test

# Run specific test
swift test --filter CitationManagerTests
```

### Writing Tests

We test the important stuff:
- Google Scholar HTML parsing
- Data persistence and migration
- Rate limiting logic
- Error handling scenarios

```swift
func testCitationParsing() {
    let mockHTML = """
    <td class="gsc_rsb_std">1,337</td>
    """
    
    let count = CitationParser.extractCitationCount(from: mockHTML)
    XCTAssertEqual(count, 1337)
}
```

### Manual Testing

Don't forget to test:
- Different Google Scholar profile formats
- Network error scenarios
- App startup with no internet
- Menu bar behavior on different macOS versions
