# CiteBar

A macOS menu bar application that helps academics track their Google Scholar citation metrics in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time Citation Tracking**: Monitor your Google Scholar citations directly from your menu bar
- **Multiple Profile Support**: Track citations for yourself and collaborators
- **Historical Data**: View citation growth trends over time
- **Configurable Updates**: Set custom refresh intervals to respect Google's rate limits
- **Clean Interface**: Elegant, unobtrusive design that stays out of your way
- **Auto-launch**: Optionally start with macOS for continuous monitoring

## Installation

### Option 1: Build from Source

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Xcode Command Line Tools installed:
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CiteBar.git
   cd CiteBar
   ```

3. Build and run:
   ```bash
   make build
   make run
   ```

4. Or install to Applications:
   ```bash
   make install
   ```

### Option 2: Download Release

Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/hichipli/CiteBar/releases) and drag to your Applications folder.

## Usage

1. **First Time Setup**: 
   - Click the CiteBar icon in your menu bar
   - Select "Settings..."
   - Add your Google Scholar profile(s)

2. **Finding your Google Scholar ID**:
   - Go to your Google Scholar profile
   - Your ID is in the URL: `scholar.google.com/citations?user=YOUR_ID_HERE`
   - Copy just the ID part (e.g., `ABC123DEF`)

3. **Configure Settings**:
   - Set refresh intervals (recommended: 1 hour or more)
   - Enable/disable profiles as needed
   - Configure notifications and auto-launch

## Google Scholar Integration

CiteBar scrapes citation data from public Google Scholar profiles. To avoid being rate-limited:

- Use refresh intervals of 1 hour or more
- Don't add too many profiles
- The app automatically adds delays between requests

**Important**: CiteBar only accesses publicly available Google Scholar data. No private information is accessed or stored.
